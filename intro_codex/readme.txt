# Introduction to Codex

Codex is an AI model that translates natural language instructions into code. You can describe the desired functionality in plain English and Codex will suggest code snippets that accomplish the task.

## Getting Started
1. Write a clear description of the task or problem.
2. Review the code Codex generates and modify it as needed.
3. Run the code in your development environment to verify it works.

## Tips
- Be specific about the programming language or frameworks you want to use.
- Iterate by refining your instructions if the first attempt is not perfect.
- Always test the generated code to ensure it meets your requirements.

Codex can accelerate development by handling boilerplate code and providing examples for unfamiliar APIs.
